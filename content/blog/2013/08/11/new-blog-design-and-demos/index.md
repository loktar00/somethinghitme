I was really hating my last design, so after saying I was going to do it for months I finally decided to redesign the blog. There's a few things left to do like styling comment boxes, finishing the mobile version, and a few finishing touches here and there. My favorite part though about going to a design with so much white space is the ability to have some of my demos as the background. I will of course however be adding an option to turn them off for those of you who get distracted or think they are just plain ugly.

I finally feel like I can start writing some articles about my demos, games in progress, and everything else!
