I can't believe it's been 6 years since my last post on here. The last time I posted it was a few months after starting my most recent job which has obviously kept me incredibly busy since.

Just a quick update before I start writing more frequently. I've been using react pretty heavily fully implementing it at the workplace in all facets which has been an absolute joy. In addition I've been working on some side projects with it as well, to include this blog which is now off of the old wordpress backend and using gatsby. [Full source is here](https://github.com/loktar00/somethinghitme).

Lots of broken posts in terms of formatting and some missing files I need to get moved over in the next few days, however the template I made for the last one is almost the same with gatsby, was pretty easy since I had such a simple template to begin with.

Looking ahead I have some ideas on a few projects I want to share and get working on, I've made quite a few cool things and have jumped into quite a few different hobbies since my last post 6 years ago which I hope to share.
